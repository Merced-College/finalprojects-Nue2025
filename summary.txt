A Java program with a terminal-based search engine and trivia game. As of 4/29/2025, I have built a simple TUI (Text User Interface) 
to accomodate the user with searching a particular National Park, looking for a state, and implementing an interactive game. 
I need to create more classes and write code to help the user access more data of the park. Visitor count, climate, location 
(in Latitude and longitude), and other facts about the national park.
