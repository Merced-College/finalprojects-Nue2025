The app I created is the National Park Search and Trivia Game. This app is comprised of a search engine and a trivia game, with a user-friendly menu. If you're a tourist from another country or even a local resident of the state, you may want to learn more about the parks. You can visit this program to get fast, quick, and easy information. The program works because of three algorithms, data structures, and user-friendly methods.
